for homework for Thurs 1-29:
read ch. 4 and 6 in Python for Biologists,
read 4.4 and 4.5 in scb (Allesina course notes)
do exercise 4.6.1 in scb p. 51
no need to run code in exercise, just a thought experiment
turn into CCLE by Thurs 8 am

4.6.1
#how many times will 'hello' be printed?
1. 14
2. 4
3. 3 for if; 3 for elif = 6 total
4. 5
5. 1 + 7 = 8 total
6.a) foo1 returns square root of x
b) foo2 returns x if > y; otherwise, returns y
c) foo3 returns a list: x swaps values with y if x > y,
y swaps values with z if y > z, if x > y again then x swaps with y again
so ultimately x swaps values with z. In practice, this reorders x, y, and z
from smallest to largest. If put in 3, 2, 1 the output is 1, 2, 3
but because y swaps with z also if y > z, 1, 3, 2 would also be
reordered to 1, 2, 3
d) foo4 returns the factorial of x (ranges are exclusive at the upper end)
e) foo5 also returns the factorial of x. returning 1 if x == 1 prevents it
from going to zero.
